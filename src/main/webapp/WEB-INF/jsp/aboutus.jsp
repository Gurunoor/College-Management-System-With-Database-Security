			information of the need of proposed system are:</h3>
		<h4 align="center">
			<strong style="color: red">Performance:</strong> During past several
			decades, the records are supposed to be manually handled for all
			activities. The manual handling of the record is time consuming and
			highly prone to error. To improve the performance of the system, the
			computerized system is to be undertaken.The computerized project is
			fully computerized and user friendly even that any of the members can
			see the report and status of the company.
		</h4>
		<br>
		<h4 align="center">
			<strong style="color: red">Efficiency:</strong> The basic need of
			this website is efficiency. The website should be efficient so that
			whenever a new user submit his/her details the website is updated
			automatically. This record will be useful for other users instantly.
		</h4>
		<br>
		<h4 align="center">
			<strong style="color: red">Control:</strong> The complete control of
			the project is under the hands of authorized person who has the
			password to access this project and illegal access is not supposed to
			deal with. All the control is under the administrator and the other
			members have the rights to just see the records not to change any
			transaction or entry.
		</h4>
		<br>
		<h4 align="center">
			<strong style="color: red">Security:</strong> Security is the main
			criteria for the proposed system. Since illegal access may corrupt
			the database. So security has to be given in this project.
